A Marimo notebook has been set up to help debug the app.

Run locally with:

```sh
pip install marimo anywidget polars requests
marimo run dashboard.py
```

## GitHub Copilot Configuration

This repository includes configuration for GitHub Copilot Cloud Agent to access external domains:

- **`.github/agents/copilot-setup-steps.yml`**: Grants Copilot access to marimo.io domains (molab playground) and tennis court booking APIs. This allows Copilot to:
  - Access and debug the marimo notebook on molab
  - Fetch tennis court availability data
  - Resolve "failed to fetch wire" errors when accessing molab links

## Pre-commit Hooks
